## Abstract

This research proposal examines the educational disparities among Aboriginal communities and the factors that contribute to a lack of resources. Although the research draws on data from District 91 of northern British Columbia communities, the overall scope of research covers Canada as a whole. It analyzes multiple factors contributing to the disparities seen in Aboriginal communities, as well as computer model development to identify disparities at an interpersonal level. The research includes the study of the lasting effects of residential schools, community initiatives, educational resources, and multiple other data points relating to lower graduation rates and higher dropout rates among Aboriginal students. Implications suggest new frameworks for incorporating cultural and community well-being in measuring academic success.

## Overview of Educational Disparities in Aboriginal Communities

The historical legacy of residential schools has left a profound impact on the academic success of Aboriginal communities, these institutions systematically disrupted traditional education systems, leading to significant educational disparities. Data from District 91 reveals that approximately 30% of students in fourteen First Nation communities are Indigenous, with over half living on-reservation (Louie & Prince, 2023). This demographic has unique challenges due to limited resource access and a lack of culturally responsive education.

The educational outcomes for Aboriginal students often fall behind their non-Indigenous peers, with higher dropout rates and lower graduation rates (Khan et al., 2024). Factors contributing to these disparities include systemic poverty, cultural disconnection from education, and inadequate access to culturally responsive teaching practices. Addressing these issues requires an approach that integrates community-based initiatives, cultural integration, and innovative tools like predictive modelling.

## Historical Context and Impact of Residential Schools

The intergenerational trauma from Canada's residential school system continues to influence educational outcomes for Indigenous students across the country. Residential schools systematically disrupted Indigenous knowledge systems and family structures, creating educational disparities that persist today. These institutions operated with the explicit goal of cultural assimilation, separating children from their communities and prohibiting traditional languages and practices.

Garnet Angeconeb's experience illustrates the profound impact of these institutions. As documented in testimonials, Garnet experienced both physical and sexual abuse while attending residential school, trauma that remained unacknowledged for years. "The first time that I had ever told anybody in a way that I was of a sown mind... I was sober. I was hungover, but I was sober. And I was able to find the strength to say yes, I was abused." This experience reflects the reality many survivors facedâ€”carrying unresolved trauma that affected their relationship with educational institutions.

The residential school legacy created a complex relationship with education for many Aboriginal communities. As Garnet explains regarding his experience after leaving residential school: "After I left here and started going to high school, those were confusing years. What I would say the last years where I was confused, I really had an identity crisis. I'm Anishinaabe, I'm thinking white, but I'm not white. My body is still brown." This cultural disconnection represents a significant barrier to educational success that continues to affect Aboriginal students today.

## Current Educational Challenges and Contributing Factors

The educational disparities facing Aboriginal communities stem from multiple interconnected factors beyond the residential school legacy. Aboriginal students continue to experience higher dropout rates and lower graduation rates compared to non-Indigenous peers. These disparities reflect systemic issues rather than individual capabilities.

One key contributing factor is cultural disconnection in educational environments. The standard curriculum often lacks meaningful integration of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives, creating a sense of alienation for Aboriginal students.

Another significant factor is intergenerational trauma. The experiences of residential school survivors continue to affect family dynamics and attitudes toward formal education systems. As Garnet Angeconeb says when speaking about his grandchildren: "When I look into the eyes of Isabella and Nellie... I have to ask myself what kind of a legacy or what kind of a society am I trying to create for you? The damage, the hurt, the pain, the suffering has to stop somewhere." This reflective questioning highlights how past educational traumas influence current approaches to education.

Finally, personal impacts on family systems. The trauma experienced in residential schools often affected parenting abilities and family dynamics. Garnet acknowledges: "I have to honestly tell you the way it was. It was that I drove Margaret and my kids into what I call a living hell for them. It was not good. Very tough times, dark hours. One of the things about the residential school system was that it made me a very angry person."

## Community Engagement Approaches

Effective approaches to reducing educational disparities must center on Aboriginal community involvement and leadership. Many Aboriginal communities have sought to gain opportunities to enact their vision of what education can be, one that often emphasizes preserving cultural identity while providing skills needed for success in contemporary society.

Some successful community-led initiatives include programs that developed with direct input from affected community members tend to demonstrate higher relevance and effectiveness. Incorporating different cultural elements such as languages, traditional knowledge, and teaching methods will enhance educational engagement among Aboriginal students. This integration acknowledges the validity of Indigenous knowledge systems along with conventional academic subjects.

Community healing initiatives have proven to be effective in improving educational outcomes when they address historical trauma through programs informed by real survivor testimonies or similar efforts. These approaches not only help individuals process their experiences but also lay a foundation for achieving educational success, thereby contributing to overall community well-being.

Engaging in dialogues and fostering open communication about historical trauma plays a crucial role in promoting healing within communities. As Garnet stated: "Because I think when you create that dialogue it's healthy. It's healthy for those people you're asking, it's healthy for you. And I guess another one told me don't be afraid to talk because through communication there's a lot of healing." This highlights the dual benefits of such initiatives in supporting both individual healing and community cohesion.

## Proposed Action Framework

Based on evidence from existing research and testimonials, an effective framework for addressing educational disparities should incorporate multiple dimensions:

Cultural responsiveness is essential, requiring educational materials and methodologies to reflect Aboriginal perspectives and knowledge systems. Collaboration with Aboriginal communities is key to identifying appropriate content and teaching methods.

Technology integration can address access barriers by connecting remote communities to educational resources while preserving cultural authenticity through digital tools like machine learning models tailored for specific areas or general technology education lacking among older generations and the public.

Trauma-informed approaches must acknowledge the intergenerational impacts of residential schools and historical injustices, with staff training emphasizing how historical trauma influences educational engagement and achievement.

Recognizing that residential school history is a shared part of Canadian history is vital. Garnet highlighted that it's not just about Aboriginal people but a shared history for all Canadians due to the residential school policy established by the federal government. Educational efforts must therefore acknowledge this shared history.

Policy advocacy at institutional, provincial, and federal levels is necessary to address structural barriers and ensure sustainable improvement in educational outcomes informed by successful local initiatives.

Through this comprehensive framework, educational disparities affecting Aboriginal communities can be systematically addressed while honouring community autonomy and cultural continuity.

## Conclusion

Educational disparities affecting Aboriginal communities stem from historical injustices, particularly the residential school system, which created intergenerational trauma influencing academic outcomes today. As evidenced by Garnet Angeconeb's experiences, addressing these disparities requires acknowledging this painful history while implementing practical solutions.

The frameworks proposed emphasize community engagement, cultural integration, trauma-informed practices, and appropriate technology implementation. These strategies recognize that educational success cannot be separated from community healing and cultural continuity.

The responsibility for change far extends just the responsibilities of Aboriginal communities, including educational institutions, policymakers, and Canadian society. As Garnet reflects regarding future generations: "The damage, the hurt, the pain, the suffering has to stop somewhere." This sentiment captures the core motivationâ€”creating systems where Aboriginal students thrive academically while maintaining strong connections to their cultural identity. Through meaningful collaboration and commitment to addressing both historical injustices and current challenges, progress toward educational equity is achievable.
